# Simple Gulp template for creating a web page

This template does not apply the 7-1 pattern of Sass.
All the Sass files and Pug files are stored in their same directories.

Run the command `gulp` to automatically run your tasks.
If you face any error. Please use these following commands:
`npm install -g gulp sass`
`npm install --save-dev gulp sass gulp-sass gulp-pug-3 browser-sync`
then try using `gulp` to run again.
